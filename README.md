# Multilateration Algorithms
A collection of the implementation of various [True-range Multilateration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True-range_multilateration) algoritms in C++ using Eigen.


**True-range multilateration** is a method to determine the position of a point in space by using multiple ranges between the point and known locations (anchors).
